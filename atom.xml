    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We haven’t decided yet if the players will start with an Colonel or if they have to train him from another unit. The plus side if the player will start with him, all the Colonels will have the same skills at level zero.</p>

<p><strong>Colonel Skills</strong></p>

<p>A Colonel will gain two or three points per level that you can distribute between the following skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Offensive Bonus</li>
<li>Defensive Bonus</li>
</ul>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s explain the different types of skills</p>

<p><strong>Strength</strong></p>

<p>How strong the Colonel will be, let&rsquo;s say it have 10.000 in fighting strength, and you attack an army with an total of 5.000 defensive strength and your Colonel have 100% health before the attack, it will kill all the enemy troops and return with 50% health points. Logic we know but in more complex situation it can be hard to predict the results and for these situations, we will create a combat simulator also.</p>

<p><strong>Offensive Bonus</strong></p>

<p>All troops attacking with the Colonel will get this bonus, let&rsquo;s say you have 3% offensive bonus and you attack with a total of 4 troops with 50 offensive strength each, the total offensive strength will be 206 with the above example. This bonus will not apply to the Colonels strength.</p>

<p><strong>Defensive Bonus</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s works the same as Offensive Bonus but for the defending units, one thing though is that this bonus only applies to the player troops. So you can&rsquo;t reinforce a planet with different Colonels and get the bonus from all of them, pretty self-explained but anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Colonel in the different races</strong></p>

<p>This section will be updated when we have chosen the different races and what benefits you get from each and one of them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re going to create a MMORTS game that you play via your web browser. We are now going to explain the basic of the game setup, but have a little indulgence that things can be changed from time to time.
The goal with the game is just to learn, learn and learn. The best way to learn something is to do it with fun and who doesn’t like games?</p>

<p><strong>Information about the game and the game play</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing special about it, you create an account, choose your race  and your planet will automatically be created with some basic features. Then you need to build different buildings to achieve your own goals which can be to eliminate your neighbor but more information about this in a later post.</p>

<p>Some of the features the game will provide is that you can choose from 2-3 different races (not yet decided) there will also be a race that is not playable by people, the later race is controlled by the computer and it will work like a normal account, it will build things, train troops and attack normal players and expand with new plantes. It’s a very powerful race so it’s nothing you attack in the early stage of the game and neither will she, she actually has honor and a little sympathy.</p>
